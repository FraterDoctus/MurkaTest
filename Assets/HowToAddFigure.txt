To add new figure you need to:
1. Go to "Resources/Figures" folder. 
2. Duplicate one of already created figure.
3. Go to "Polygon->Vertices" in figure settings and set vertices.
4. Change "Max Passing Len" if needed.

P.S.
- Be aware, you need to add vertices in right order
- Figures will appear in the game by their name in the folder.
